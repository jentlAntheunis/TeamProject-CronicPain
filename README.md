## Info

This is a project by second-year Multimedia and Creative Technologies students at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Kortrijk, Belgium.  
Our goal is to make an app for patients with chronic pains, to motivate them to move (which will reduce the pain in the long term) and to gather data throughout the week that can be used at their appointment with a physiotherapist or doctor.  
We opted for a Duolingo-like approach, with a playful avatar that motivates the user throughout the app and can be customized with rewards the user gets for moving and filling in questionnaires.  
We had a preparation week from 6-9-2023 to 10-9-2023 and worked on the project from 8-1-2024 to 30-1-2024.

We proudly present:

> The name Pebbles, both of our app as well as our avatar, stands for slow and steady growth towards less pain, taking small steps and being happy with every little piece of progress.

## Tech stack

- ### Frontend
    We went with React for our frontend, and used Vercel for continuous deployment during development.

- ### Backend
    For our backend, we set up an ASP.NET program, and deployed it on an Azure API App using Github Actions.

- ### Hosting
    For our DNS Server, we turned to Combell, which offers a free domain for every Howest student.

- ### Database
    As Combell also offers a database service with the hosting plan, we went with that.
