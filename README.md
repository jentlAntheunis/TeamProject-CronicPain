## Info

This is a project by second-year Multimedia and Creative Technologies students at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Kortrijk, Belgium.  
Our goal is to make an app for patients with chronic pains, to motivate them to move (which will reduce the pain in the long term) and to gather data throughout the week that can be used at their appointment with a physiotherapist or doctor.  
We opted for a Duolingo-like approach, with a playful avatar that motivates the user throughout the app and can be customized with rewards the user gets for moving and filling in questionnaires.  
We had a preparation week from 6-9-2023 to 10-9-2023 and worked on the project from 8-1-2024 to 30-1-2024.
